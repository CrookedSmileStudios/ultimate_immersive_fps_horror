class_name AbstractInteraction
extends Node

"""
AbstractInteraction is the base class for all interactable objects in the game.
It defines the common interface (preInteract, interact, auxInteract, postInteract)
and shared state (can_interact, is_interacting, lock_camera, nodes_to_affect).
Concrete interaction types (e.g. doors, switches, notes, keypads) should extend
this class and implement their own interaction-specific behavior while reusing
the common logic provided here.
