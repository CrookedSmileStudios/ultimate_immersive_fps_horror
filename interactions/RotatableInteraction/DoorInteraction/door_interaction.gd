class_name DoorInteraction
extends RotatableInteraction

"""
DoorInteraction handles all player interaction logic for hinged doors.

Features:
- Supports locked and unlocked states, including a small "wiggle" motion and
  locked sound feedback when the player attempts to open a locked door.
- Tracks door velocity and applies smoothing for realistic swing motion.
- Plays creaking sounds when the door is moved past a velocity threshold, with
  dynamic volume scaling based on movement speed.
- Plays a shut/impact sound when the door returns to the closed position.
- Resets state cleanly when a door is unlocked, ensuring it snaps back to
  starting rotation without carrying over unintended velocity.

Use this class for standard hinged doors that open on a pivot.
