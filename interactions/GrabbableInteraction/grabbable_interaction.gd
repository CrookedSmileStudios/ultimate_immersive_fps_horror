class_name GrabbableInteraction
extends AbstractInteraction

"""
GrabbableInteraction handles objects that the player can pick up, carry, and throw.
It extends AbstractInteraction to reuse common interaction logic while adding
pickup-specific behavior such as following the playerâ€™s hand, applying physics-based
movement, and playing collision sound effects when the object hits other surfaces.

This class is suitable for any interactable object that should respond to grab-and-throw
mechanics in the game world.
